Requirements:
1. Ability to create Product Types via a form in the UI. There should also be a page for displaying a list of all product types.
2. Ability to create a Product via a form in the UI and assign it to a product type (e.g. Skittles is a Candy). There should be a page for displaying a list of all products, with references to which product type they are assigned to. In the Rails world, you would use 'associations' to assign products to product types.
3. Ability to sort the list of products on the page by name or created date.
4. Ability to edit a product.
